# Hypercard Sign In Clone

This project is a clone of [Hypercard](https://app.hypercard.com). The purpose of this clone is to replicate the UI of the original application.

## Demo

You can check out the live version hosted on Vercel here: [Live Demo](https://hypercard-puce.vercel.app/)

## Technologies Used

- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

## Potential Improvements

While the current version replicates the UI of Hypercard Sign In, several enhancements can be made to the codebase for future iterations:

1. **Testing**: Introduce unit tests to ensure the core logic of the application works as expected. Leverage libraries like Jest and React Testing Library to write tests for individual components and functions. Unit testing will help catch bugs early, improve code quality, and maintain stability as the application evolves. Ensure tests are comprehensive and cover edge cases to prevent regressions.
2. **Class Variance Authority**: Use Class Variance Authority (CVA) for managing complex class names in Tailwind CSS. This will improve styling efficiency and help maintain a consistent design system, making it easier to handle conditional class names and improve component reusability.
3. **Authentication**: Implement user authentication using Google's OAuth provider and email/password login.
4. **State Management**: Introduce a state management library to manage application state more effectively.
5. **Error Handling**: Introduce error boundaries and user-friendly messages for handling cases where the application might fail to load resources.
6. **Form Validation**: Implement client-side form validation using a library like Zod in combination with React Hook Form. This will ensure that user input is validated before submission, improving data integrity and user experience by providing immediate feedback for invalid inputs. 
7. **Storybook**: Integrate Storybook into the development process to build and showcase individual UI components in isolation. This will boost team collaboration and make it easier to understand the components by visualizing their different states and variations.
8. **SEO Optimization**: Add metadata, structured data, and other SEO enhancements to improve search engine visibility.
9. **Accessibility**: Improve accessibility by ensuring the app is navigable using screen readers and keyboard-only users. Adding aria-labels and semantic HTML can enhance this.
10. **Animations**: Add smooth, engaging animations to enhance the user experience. Use libraries like Framer Motion or React Spring to animate components and transitions, making the app feel more dynamic and interactive.
